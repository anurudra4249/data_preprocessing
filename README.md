# Data Preprocessing:
   -Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle missing values in the dataset. You can either remove rows or columns with missing values or impute them using techniques like mean, median, or regression imputation.
   - Data Cleaning: Remove any irrelevant or duplicate data, correct inconsistencies, and address outliers if necessary.
   - Feature Scaling: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure they are on a similar scale, such as using techniques like min-max scaling or z-score normalization.
   - Encoding Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical representations. Common techniques include one-hot encoding, label encoding, or target encoding.
   - Handling Skewed Data: Adjust skewed features by applying transformations like logarithmic or power transformations to achieve a more normal distribution.
